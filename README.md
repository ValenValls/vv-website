# Django Blog Website with AI Comments

This is a Django test website, based on the Django tutorial found on https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/.
The website is hosted and can be seen on https://valenvalls.pythonanywhere.com/.

The twist of the website is that a when a post is made, a historical person will comment on it.
It uses Google's GenAI Model to generate the comments.
